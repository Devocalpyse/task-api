# task-api
A RESTful API to manage tasks with using the task-client app

## Intro
This API is built using TS, MongoDB/Mongoose, and Express middleware. This is the sibling project to [task-client](https://github.com/Devocalpyse/task-client), an Ionic/React web app for managing tasks.

## How Do I use this?

Simple! Just clone both repositories and install the necessary modules, mostly with `npm install` since both are built with NodeJS. You will also need MongoDB installed specifically for this project, likely locally since I am still unsure how to use in the cloud or whatnot.
